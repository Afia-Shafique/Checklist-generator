    "content": "The DBC incorporates, unifies and replaces the regulations related to building design published by Dubai Municipality (DM), Dubai Development Authority (DDA), Department of Planning and Development – Ports Customs and Freezone Corporation (Trakhees) and Dubai Silicon Oasis Authority (DSOA). Regulations related to building design by Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department (IACAD) are incorporated or cross-referenced by the DBC. Regulations related to building design by the Security Industry Regulatory Agency (SIRA) are summarized and cross-referenced in Part J. Federal regulations also remain in place. The DBC follows the Federal regulations of Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) and the Ministry of Interior Civil Defence. The TRA regulations are given in G.11. The UAE Fire and Life Safety Code (UAE FLSC) [Ref. A.1] is cross-referenced throughout the DBC. Accessibility requirements of the Dubai Universal Design Code [Ref. A.2] applicable to building design are incorporated in Part C and replace these aspects of the Dubai Universal Design Code. The Dubai Health Authority (DHA) regulations [Ref. A.3 and Ref. A.4], along with the relevant Federal regulations, shall be followed for the design of all healthcare facilities. The Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM) sets out the requirements to achieve star ratings for hotels, resorts, hotel apartments and guest houses [Ref. A.5]. Achieving the minimum requirements of the DBC does not guarantee a rating from DTCM. DTCM should be consulted at the earliest stage of design. The Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) and the Ministry of Education both license education facilities, but they do not provide separate design requirements. Education facilities are approved by the main Authorities in accordance with the DBC. Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) regulations in relation to the right of way are referenced by the DBC as appropriate. Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) regulates maximum building heights within the flight path. Regulations related to permitting, procedures, construction and design of non-building elements such as infrastructure, transportation systems, and the public realm remain, and can be obtained from, the relevant Authority. Planning development regulations published by Developers or Planning Authorities are not replaced by the DBC. The DBC contains planning regulations in Part B, but these shall be followed only where plot-specific planning development regulations are unavailable.A.4.2 International codes and standards The DBC relies on international codes and standards, mainly BS EN and American codes. These codes and standards shall be used in their latest edition except where the DBC lists an edition. NOTE: As an example, Part F (Structures) mandates the 2016 edition of ASCE/SEI 7. An edition is mandated in the DBC for one of two reasons. a) The DBC refers to sections, tables and figures within that version of the international code or standard and therefore the cross-references might not apply to later editions. b) The edition has been reviewed for its applicability to Dubai.",

Assistive listening system (ALS): Amplification system utilizing transmitters, receivers and coupling devices to bypass the acoustical space between a sound source and a listener by means of induction loop, radio frequency, infrared or direct-wired equipment.Bollards: Vertical posts that separate a pedestrian path from vehicular traffic. Characters: Letters, numbers, punctuation marks and typographic symbols. Children’s use: Design of spaces and elements specifically for use primarily by people 12 years old and younger. Clear width: Free unobstructed space for access. Cross-slope: Slope that is perpendicular to the direction of travel. Curb ramp: Element of an accessible pedestrian route that connects different levels through inclined planes, usually between the roadway and the sidewalk. Detectable warning: Standardized surface feature built into or applied to walking surfaces or other elements to warn of hazards on a circulation route. Flare: Sloped surface that flanks a curb ramp and provides a graded transition between the ramp and the sidewalk. Functional limitations: Restrictions in performing fundamental physical and mental actions in daily life, such as mobility (physical) or memory (mental). Gangway: Variable-sloped pedestrian walkway that links a fixed structure or land with a vessel.Gross area (GA): Floor area within the inside perimeter of the exterior walls of a building. The measurement excludes shafts and courtyards, but includes corridors, stairways, ramps, closets, base of atria (or similar voids) and the thickness of interior walls, columns or other features. Handrail: Horizontal or sloping rail intended for handhold and grasping by hand for guidance or support. Interaction space: Space required by a person to interact with another person, furniture, appliance, machine or another item or to transfer from a wheelchair to a seat or a toilet or to park a pram. Landing: Floor area at the top of a flight of stairs or between two flights of stairs, or a platform or part of a floor structure at the end of a ramp or at the entrance to an elevator car. Light reflectance value (LRV): Proportion of visible light reflected by a surface at all wavelengths and directions when illuminated by a light source, expressed on a scale of 0 to 100, with a value of 0 for pure black and a value of 100 for pure white. Luminance: Amount of light emitted from a surface or source in any given direction. Manifestation: Clear markings on transparent glazing to enable occupants to see the glazing as a hazard to be avoided.",

Building envelope: Physical barrier between the exterior and the conditioned environment of a building to resist air, water, moisture, heat, cold, light, and noise transfer. For an air-conditioned building, the building envelope comprises the elements of a building that separate conditioned spaces from the exterior. Crown extensions to the façade to cover plant screen cladding are part of the building envelope. The building envelope does not include the physical barrier below ground. Building maintenance unit: Permanently installed unit that provides easy and safe access to the building envelope for maintenance, inspections and cleaning. Containment: Glass barrier resisting penetration and preventing people from falling even after failure or breakage. Damp-proof course: Layer of waterproof material or construction in the wall of a building near the ground, primarily to prevent rising damp. Damp-proof membrane: Material applied to prevent moisture transmission. Drained air space: Air layer within a wall that allows any entering water or moisture to be drained out.Glazed element: Individual element within a building envelope that lets in light, including windows, plastic panels, clerestories, skylights, doors that are more than one half glass, and glass block walls. Glazing: Glass that is installed as one of the components of a wall, floor, ceiling or roofing system. Gross wall area: Area of the wall that provides the thermal barrier of the building. It includes the solid area and any openings in the wall, such as doors or windows. It is the actual measured area, not the projected area on a drawing. Groundwater pressure: Pressure of groundwater held within a soil or rock, in gaps between particles. Guardrail: Vertical protective barrier erected along elevated walking surfaces, exposed edges of stairways, balconies and similar areas that minimizes the possibility of fall from elevated surfaces to lower level.

The Engineer shall modify the durability specification based on the structural design (service life, exposure conditions, concrete grade, concrete cover, etc.).NOTE: The following notes are applicable to both (Table F.3 and F.11) mix design approaches. a) Silica fume may be added to the concrete mixes to achieve the required strength and/or durability requirements of any project. b) Testing of concrete specimens at 56 days for compressive strength may be allowed for mixes with high percentages of cement replacements. c) Temporary works (such as shoring, shotcrete, etc.) do not need to conform to this specification. d) Screed not providing structural protection does not need to conform to this specification. e) The use of a high percentage of ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) in concrete mixes may cause difficulties in handling concrete (pumping, placing, finishing, etc.). It is therefore recommended to specify and accept higher slumps for such mixes in order to avoid any addition of water to the concrete mix on the construction site. f) The minimum recommended clear concrete cover to reinforcement for substructures is 50 mm/75 mm (50 mm for concrete cast against blinding; 75 mm for concrete cast directly against soil) and 30 mm for superstructures.

For effects on covered concrete structural members, mean monthly temperatures should be used to establish an appropriate temperature range. A default thermal range of ±20 °C may be used for exposed elements above ground level and ±15 °C for non-exposed elements (i.e. basement). Gradient thermal analysis (non-uniform) shall be applied for permanently exposed slabs like roofs and exposed last podium floors. For steel structural members and structural members exposed to solar radiation, a range equivalent to the maximum temperature swing is appropriate. A default thermal range of ±25 °C may be used for protected steel elements. For exposed steelwork, this can arise from hourly maxima and minima. The Engineer shall assess the thermal range and assess the thermally induced forces on a case by case basis considering the construction stages, exposure and when the steel structure is locked in the final configuration.",

    "content": "Any beam, slab or truss structure used to redirect the vertical gravity or lateral load path of upper stories to the vertical structure of the lower stories shall be treated as a transfer element. Such elements are typically used where a change of use on a floor dictates a different column or wall arrangement, or to accommodate architectural features. Transfer structures have significant design, cost, material and construction schedule implications, requiring careful consideration of construction logistics, as well as consideration of the impact of long-term deflections of the transfer members and supporting elements. As such, transfer structures should be avoided where possible.The following shall be included in the design of transfer elements. a) Transfer beams are to be supported on at least two direct supports. b) Eccentricity between the column axis and the longitudinal axis of the beam is not permitted. The load transferred to the planted column, transfer beam or slab shall not be less than the loads calculated by manual method (tributary area). c) Any structural elements supporting planted/floating columns that might cause a progressive collapse are to be included as a key element. Reinforcement shall be detailed to facilitate robustness by means of provision of adequate peripheral, vertical and horizontal ties. d) The entire length of the supporting columns shall be included as critical length and the stirrups shall be spaced closely to provide effective confinement for the columns. e) Structural systems elements of the planted portions of the structure shall have redundancy to provide alternative load paths in the case of failure of any structural member, as discussed under F.5.5. f) Any structural members or element that do not fall under the purview of this part should be analysed and designed for various possible critical combinations. g) Transfer structure shall be capable of withstanding the reactions from any attached building components. The reactions should be the maximum values that might reasonably be transmitted considering the strength of the attached component and its connection. h) The Engineer shall check that the deflections of the structural members supported by the transfer elements are within the deflection limits specified in F.8.3.",

    "content": "This section provides minimum geotechnical requirements that are appropriate for the geology, stratigraphy, geotechnical and groundwater conditions of Dubai. A major characteristic of the ground in Dubai is its calcareous origin for both soils (e.g. calcareous sand) and soft calcareous rocks, with clay minerals of various expansion potential. Groundwater is saline with chlorites and sulphates that make a very aggressive environment for concrete and reinforcement in the ground. The geotechnical requirements and design aspects are discussed in F.9.3 to F.9.5. The geotechnical design of buildings shall be based on the requirements stated herein and the referenced standards (see Figure F.18). This section should be also read in conjunction with all the other relevant sections of this Part. Additional studies are expected for unusual constructions, and might result in a variation from these requirements which would require approval from the Authority.

    "content": "ASCE/SEI 7-16 defines the seismic parameters using the maximum rotated component of ground motion rather than geometric mean component of ground motion. To account for this variation the component of ground motion, Malhotra [Ref. F.22] recommends the ratios in Table F.24. The proposed values are consistent with similar published factors (e.g. Beyer and Bommer [Ref. F.32]). Parameter Ratio PGA 1.20 PGV 1.22 PGD 1.25 Table F.24 Resultant/geometric mean ratios (Malhotra, 2020) ASCE/SEI 7-16 also adjusts the seismic hazard to ensure risk-consistent hazard parameters for typical USA building stock following the procedure proposed by Luco [Ref. F.33]. Malhotra [Ref. F.22] recommends that this adjustment is not made, since the building stock in Dubai is considerably different to the USA and the uncertainty in the methodology is large. F.10.2.2 Return period ASCE/SEI 7-16 defines the hazard in terms of a 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years, otherwise known as a return period of 2,475 years. As discussed in Malhotra [Ref. F.22], a factor of two-thirds is applied to approximate the hazard in the USA to approximate a return period of 475 years, as used in the previous degeneration of seismic codes. This is an arbitrary requirement, which is country specific. In contrast the Canadian building Code uses a 2,475-year return period directly. The reason is because this lower probability is considered to provide a more uniform margin of collapse, one that is much nearer to the probability of structural failure. Similarly, the UK National Annex to BS EN 1998-1 also uses a 2,475-year return period. This is to ensure seismic design is applied to the most critical structures in what is generally a region of very low seismicity. Since Dubai is principally affected by large distant events in Iran, it is considered appropriate not to reduce the seismic hazard level using the arbitrary two-thirds factor used in the USA, but ensure seismic design caters for these larger events. This should not increase the seismic demand compared to current design practice.",

DSCB represents the allowable upper limit for the environmental weighted average impact (WAI) of concrete mixes which was based on an industry-wide lifecycle assessment (LCA) and environmental product declaration conducted for the most common concrete mixes used in building construction in Dubai. The WAI is calculated from the normalized LCA indicators/factors for each concrete mix including global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, abiotic depletion potential fossil, blue water consumption, reused water for washing and water for washing. Table F.25 lists all the concrete mixes forming DSCB. Full details about the concrete mix proportions, environmental impacts, and WAI can be accessed through a web- based concrete calculator. DSCB does not consider the durability aspects for any one of the concrete mixes listed in Table F.25. It is recommended to consult a design engineer for the right durability specification for every project based on the prevailing conditions of the structure (service life, exposure conditions, concrete grade, concrete cover and any other relevant parameter affecting durability) and in line with F.5.6. The aim is to encourage the industry to produce more sustainable concrete, eventually resulting in lowering the impact of concrete construction on the environment. It is essential to balance the specification of concrete for sustainability while ensuring other performance parameters are optimized. Engineers are urged not to over-specify concrete strength and/or durability parameters and to permit flexibility in designing the concrete mixes in a way that encourages the production of more sustainable concrete.F.11.2 DM concrete calculator DM concrete calculator serves as a tool to help members assess their concrete mixes against DSCB by changing different parameters and prior to submitting for DM approval.

These requirements are based on version two of the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority (TRA), In- Building Telecommunication Network – Specification Manual Guidelines for FTTx in new Buildings [Ref. G.10]. If the TRA is updated to give more stringent requirements, these shall be used in preference to the DBC. This section specifies the minimum requirements to provide a baseline infrastructure. There is no restriction to extending the baseline, provided that the design meets the requirements in this section and does not prevent competition, e.g. by using proprietary standards. All telecom infrastructure shall enable each user/ tenant freedom of choice between telecommunication service providers (SPs). The requirements cover all of the following aspects of infrastructure: a) civil infrastructure and entry ducts; b) fibre concentration point (FCP) space(s) per development or plot; c) meet-me-room (MMR) space(s) per development or plot; d) telecom rooms; e) indoor mobile service and rooftop rooms; f) building pathways; g) OSP cables; h) ISP cables. Passive optical fibre infrastructure shall be provided to support deployment of FTTx. Copper access networks shall not be used for SP services. All buildings shall be equipped with physical infrastructure capable of supporting multiple high- speed SP networks which can be easily accessed by the SP. The Developer shall assume a minimum of two active SPs in the region, but may future-proof the infrastructure by incorporating provision to support a possible third SP.New installations shall be based upon a minimum of category 6 balanced twisted pair cabling as specified in ISO 11801 1. Designers may future-proof designs by providing category 6 A cabling, which supports higher data rates and provides support for newer power- over-ethernet (PoE) standards that are typically used for video surveillance camera and wireless local area network access points. Where category 6 A is specified, unshielded twisted pair (UTP) or shielded twisted pair (STP) may be utilized. Category 6 cabling (structured cabling system) shall as a minimum conform to the requirements specified in G.11.4.10.7. Cabling within the tenant space (e.g. multi-tenanted commercial/retail building, home, unit, flat, apartment, single family home or similar) for onward distribution of services beyond the tenant equipment is not in the scope of these requirements. The requirements of this section do not replace a detailed specification, act as instruction for untrained persons, or provide for every specific design circumstance.

Air leakage: Air that escapes from or to a building through a joint, coupling, junction, or the surfaces which enclose the building. The flow of uncontrolled air within a building through cracks or openings. Air ventilation: Share of supply air that is outdoor air, plus any recirculated air that has been filtered or otherwise treated to maintain acceptable indoor air quality. Air volume: Amount (volume) of air delivered to a space through ventilation, typically specified in litres per second or cubic metres per minute. Building envelope: Physical barrier between the exterior and the conditioned environment of a building to resist air, water, moisture, heat, cold, light, and noise transfer. For an air-conditioned building, the building envelope comprises the elements of a building that separate conditioned spaces from the exterior. Crown extensions to the façade to cover plant screen cladding are part of the building envelope. The building envelope does not include the physical barrier below ground.Cooling tower approach: Difference between the leaving water temperature and the entering air wet- bulb temperature in a cooling tower. Demand controlled ventilation (DCV): Ventilation system that provides for the automatic reduction of outdoor air intake below design rates, when the actual occupancy of spaces served by the system is less than design occupancy. Demand is often assessed by using the measure of the amount of carbon dioxide (CO 2) in a space to reflect occupancy levels. Diversity factor: Relates to the thermal characteristics of the building envelope, temperature swings and occupancy load. Ductwork: Airtight devices that carry conditioned air throughout the building. This includes terminal fixtures to distribute air. Ductwork leakage: Escape of air through cracks and gaps when air-conditioning ductwork is not airtight. Ductwork leakage results in an increase in energy consumption of supply and return air fans. Exhaust air: Air removed from a building space and discharged to the outside of the building through a mechanical or natural ventilation system. Global warming potential (GWP): Contribution of greenhouse gases released to the atmosphere in the global warming phenomenon.",

Electrical trace heating tape: Electrical multicored wire installed with thermal insulation around a pipe to maintain hot water return temperatures when a pumped hot water secondary system is not installed. Legionella bacteria: Causative agent of Legionnaires’ disease and its lesser form, Pontiac fever. Legionella generally infects the lungs through inhalation of contaminated aerosol. Legionella bacteria grow in water between 20 °C and 45 °C and can be spread by water droplets. Microbiological bacteria: Microorganism capable of causing disease that can be transmitted via the water supply. Non-potable water: Water that is not suitable for drinking but can be used for other purposes depending on its quality. Potable water: Drinking water that is suitable for human consumption. Pumped hot water return: Domestic hot water return system that uses a pump to generate circulation in the pipework system. Raw water tank: Tank that stores non-potable water and has not received any form of water treatment. Thermal balancing valve: Automatic valve that balances hot water return subcircuits. Thermostatic mixing valve: Valve with one outlet, which mixes hot and cold water and automatically controls the mixed water to a user-selected or pre-set temperature. Water outlet: Opening for the discharge of water via a plumbing fixture such as a tap or showerhead. H.2.1.3 Drainage Cesspit: Holding tank installed below ground that is used for the temporary collection of faecal matter.

    "content": "NOTE: It is common in Dubai for buildings to incorporate two potable water storage tanks (not including fire suppression water storage), with one tank located at the incoming main (basement or ground floor) and one tank at roof level. This strategy is permitted, but the popularity of pressure boosting systems has enabled cold water storage at roof level to be omitted (see Figure H.8). The location of cold-water storage tanks is also influenced by the height of the building. For high-rise buildings, intermediate water plant rooms might be required to provide a system pressure break. A risk assessment shall be carried out to determine the best location for the potable water tanks. The assessment shall take into account building spatial constraints, and access and maintenance. If there is a risk of flooding, the potable water tanks shall not be placed in areas of flooding risk such as the basement or at ground floor level. Water tanks shall be positioned as far as possible from drainage network lines, manholes, septic tanks and cesspits. In all cases, drainage pipelines shall not run above or next to above- or below-ground water tanks. DEWA shall have access to any part of the building to conduct an inspection of the water supply tanks, to verify compliance with public health conditions and associated technical specifications.",
